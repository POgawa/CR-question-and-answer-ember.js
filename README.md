##EmberJS Code Review
#Your project:

#For this project, you will make a question and answer message board. The idea is that a user can submit a question and other users can respond with answers.

#Here are the features to include:

List out all of the questions that users have asked on the main page, with just the question and the name of the author.
Allow users to add, edit and delete questions. Question properties should include question, author and description.
Let users click on a question to see all of the question properties.
Allow users to add answers for a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
Allow users to delete answers.
